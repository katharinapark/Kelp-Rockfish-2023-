# Kelp-Rockfish-2023-
This repository contains data and code for a stock assessment of kelp rockfish (Sebastes Atrovirens) in the waters off the coast of California. 
The assessment is based on a catch time series extending back to the early 1900s and an index of abundance from subtidal SCUBA surveys (1999-2021).
This assessment is intended to provide insight into the status of the kelp rockfish population over time, with the intent to provide advice for fisheries managers.

The data used in this assessment are based on surveys conducted by The Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistical Survey (MRFSS) which was used to estimate catch 
and effort of recreational marine fisheries in California from 1979 to 2003, surveys conducted by the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) which was 
used to estimate catch and effort of recreational marine fisheries in California from 2004-2022, and surveys conducted by the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) 
which was used to estimate catch and effort of commercial marine fisheries in California from 1981-2022. In addition, we use a historical catch 
reconstruction (Ralston et al. 2010) of recreational fisheries in California from 1928-1980. 

The code used in this analysis is written in R.
